# PR #1 Merge Conflict Resolution

## Overview
This document describes the resolution of merge conflicts between PR #1 (branch `copilot/vscode1760700066688`) and the `main` branch.

## Conflict Situation
The two branches had **unrelated histories** (grafted branches), which required using `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag for merging.

## Files with Conflicts
1. `.vscode/launch.json` - Removed (in .gitignore)
2. `index.html` - Merged both versions
3. `es/index.html` - Merged both versions
4. `nl/index.html` - Merged both versions
5. `package.json` - Took PR #1 version (more complete)
6. `playwright.config.ts` - Took PR #1 version (more complete)
7. `README` - Merged both versions
8. `README.me` - Merged both versions
9. `play/snake/index.html` - Took main branch version

## Resolution Strategy

### HTML Files (index.html, es/index.html, nl/index.html)
- **Kept CSP headers** from main branch (allows Sentry and other services)

### Excluded Files
- `.vscode/` directory (in .gitignore)
- `node_modules/` (in .gitignore)
