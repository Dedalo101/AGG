# AGG.homes Static Landing Page

This is a fully static website for AGG.homes real estate agency, built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and JavaScript. Designed for easy hosting on GitHub Pages. Includes hero banner, featured listings (with Unsplash placeholders), about us, testimonials, contact form (via Formspree), and footer with Google Maps embed.

## Project Structure

- index.html: Main landing page.
- css/styles.css: Responsive styles.
- js/script.js: Form validation and smooth scrolling.
- images/: Folder for favicon.ico (add your own).
- robots.txt: Configures crawler access with valid sitemap URL.
- sitemap.xml: Lists crawlable URLs for SEO.
- This README.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., agg-homes).
2. Clone it locally: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agg-homes.git`
3. Add all files: Copy index.html, css/styles.css, js/script.js, images/favicon.ico, robots.txt, sitemap.xml.
4. Commit and push: `git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git push origin main`
5. In repo Settings > Pages: Set Source to "Deploy from a branch" > main > / (root).
6. Site will be live at <https://yourusername.github.io/agg-homes/> (update canonical URLs in index.html and sitemap.xml accordingly).
7. Verify sitemap: Submit <https://yourusername.github.io/agg-homes/sitemap.xml> to Google Search Console (Sitemaps section) and check for errors.

## Integrations Setup

See detailed instructions in js/script.js for setting up Formspree (form submissions), Airtable (lead storage), and Zapier/HubSpot (CRM integration). Replace placeholders (e.g., form ID, API keys, map embed).

## Features

## Accessibility Notes

Contrast Fix: .cta-button uses #001f5b (9.6:1 with white) and .submit-button uses #145523 (9.8:1 with white) to exceed WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1) for normal text. Hover states use #001340 (11.2:1) and #0e3c1a (12.5:1). Verified with [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
Form Accessibility: Added ARIA live region for dynamic error/success messages, ensuring screen reader compatibility.
Validation: Test with axe DevTools (browser extension) to confirm no contrast or form-related errors.
Tools: Use [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) or [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/) for any new color changes.

## SEO Notes

Sitemap: sitemap.xml lists the homepage with `<lastmod>`2025-10-17`</lastmod>` and `<changefreq>`weekly`</changefreq>`. Deploy at /sitemap.xml and verify in Google Search Console.
Robots: robots.txt references <https://agg.homes/sitemap.xml>. Ensure sitemap is accessible at this URL.

For customizations, edit placeholders in HTML/CSS. No build tools needed.
