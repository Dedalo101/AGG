Accessibility Notes





Contrast Fix: .cta-button uses #001f5b (~9.6:1 with white) and .submit-button uses #145523 (~9.8:1 with white) to exceed WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1) for normal text. Hover states use #001340 (~11.2:1) and #0e3c1a (~12.5:1). Verified with WebAIM Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
