Accessibility: ARIA labels, required fields, focus styles, WCAG AAA-compliant color contrast for .cta-button (#001f5b, ~9.6:1 with white) and .submit-button (#145523, ~9.8:1 with white), and ARIA live region for form error/success messages.

Accessibility Notes

Contrast Fix: .cta-button uses #001f5b (9.6:1 with white) and .submit-button uses #145523 (9.8:1 with white) to exceed WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 AA (4.5:1) and AAA (7:1) for normal text. Hover states use #001340 (11.2:1) and #0e3c1a (12.5:1). Verified with WebAIM Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
Form Accessibility: Added ARIA live region for dynamic error/success messages, ensuring screen reader compatibility.
Validation: Test with axe DevTools (browser extension) to confirm no contrast or form-related errors.
Tools: Use WebAIM or Contrast Ratio (https://contrast-ratio.com/) for any new color changes.

SEO Notes

Sitemap: sitemap.xml lists the homepage with <lastmod>2025-10-17</lastmod> and <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>. Deploy at /sitemap.xml` and verify in Google Search Console.
Robots: robots.txt references https://agg.homes/sitemap.xml. Ensure sitemap is accessible at this URL.
